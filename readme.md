# Function Conjunction

## By NotExplosive & Ryan Yoshikami

Made in MonoGame in 48 hours for GMTK Jam. Also submitted to MonoGameJam3.

# Build It!

- First you'll need to setup MonoGame, do that here: https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/0_getting_started.html
- Then clone the repo
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the dependency (Machina, my C# game engine on top of Monogame)
- Open the solution in Visual Studio and build it... that should work... I think?
