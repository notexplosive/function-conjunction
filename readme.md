# Cunjunction Function

## By NotExplosive & Ryan Yoshikami

Made in MonoGame in 48 hours for GMTK Jam. Also submitted to MonoJam3.

# Build It!

First you'll need to setup MonoGame, do that here: https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/0_getting_started.html

Then clone the repo, open the solution in Visual Studio and build it... that should work... I think?
